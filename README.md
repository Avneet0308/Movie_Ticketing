# Movie_Ticketing
A Movie ticket booking interface made using HTML, CSS(Foundation), javascript, JSP, JDBC and oracle database

This is a simple example of making a website to book movie tickets, 
getting a seat map and when you click on a seat then the colour of the seat will change accordingly.
The booked seats will be blocked as per the data in database.
